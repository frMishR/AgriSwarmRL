# AgriSwarmRL ðŸŒ± (Under Construction)

**Status:** ðŸš§ *This project is under active development. Functionality and structure may change frequently. For any issues, contact [Ayushman Mishra (frMishR)](https://github.com/frMishR).*

## Overview

**AgriSwarmRL** simulates a swarm of drones that use computer vision and reinforcement learning to map, explore, and cover vegetated areas in real satellite fields.  
- **Vision Module:** Drones segment crops using VARI/NDVI vegetation indices.  
- **Navigation:** Coverage is planned using both rule-based logic and PPO-based RL agents.  
- **Simulator:** All experiments use the Webots robotics platform.  
- **Applications:** Precision agriculture, multi-agent robotics, drone path planning.

## Features (Planned & In Progress)

- Batch vegetation segmentation from Sentinel Playground satellite images
- Rule-based drone movement and coverage logging
- PPO agent training for optimized field exploration (coming soon)
- Multi-drone (swarm) experiments (future phase)
- MP4 demo video & results reporting
