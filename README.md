# AgriSwarmRL – Drone Vision & Reinforcement Learning for Precision Farming

## Overview
AgriSwarmRL is a research-driven project exploring how semantic segmentation of satellite/drone imagery and reinforcement learning (RL) can enable intelligent agricultural drone swarms. The current progress focuses on vegetation index computation (NDVI/VARI) from Sentinel Playground satellite images and simulated drone images (Webots). These indices provide the foundation for RL-based navigation and area coverage.

## Vision Module (Completed)
**NDVI/VARI Segmentation:**
- NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) – requires NIR band.
- VARI (Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index) – proxy for RGB-only data (Sentinel images).

**Implemented Features:**
- Loaded sample field images (synthetic, Sentinel satellite, Webots drone exports).
- Computed NDVI/VARI per pixel, generated vegetation heatmaps.
- Produced binary vegetation masks (vegetation=1, barren=0).
- Calculated area statistics (% vegetation per image).
- Saved masks and overlays to `/results/` for downstream RL use.
- Modular pipeline: any new image dropped into `/data/` is auto-processed.

## Project Roadmap
1. Phase 1 – Vision (DONE): NDVI/VARI segmentation module finalized.
2. Phase 2 – Rule-Based Drone Control (NEXT): Waypoint navigation, NDVI-driven rules in Webots.
3. Phase 3 – RL Agent (PPO): Custom Gym env, RL reward shaping from masks, PPO training.
4. Phase 4 – Multi-Drone Swarm: Collision avoidance, coordination, vegetation coverage.
5. Phase 5 – Demo & GitHub Polish: MP4 demo, final README, recruiter-ready docs.
